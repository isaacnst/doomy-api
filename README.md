# Dummy REST API for Web Application Development
This repository provides a lightweight mock REST API designed specifically for testing and development purposes. It serves as a placeholder for your actual backend services during the early stages of web application development. Whether youâ€™re building a frontend, testing client-server interactions, or creating prototypes, this API intents to offers a realistic yet fictional data.

## Features:
- JSON responses
- Metadata for entities
- Easy Integration: Use the provided endpoints to simulate API calls without connecting to a live backend.

## TODO:
- Help me to make a wishlist with awesome features
  
## How to Use:
Clone this repository to your local environment.
Start your frontend development by making requests to your custom endpoints.
Customize the responses as needed for your specific use cases.
Replace this dummy API with your actual backend services once they are ready.
Feel free to explore and experiment with this mock API as you build and refine your web application. Happy coding! ðŸš€
